# 🧠 CodeWars – C++ Practice & Fun

Welcome to my **CodeWars** repository – a place to chill and sharpen my C++ skills.  
I use this space to solve programming challenges, revisit concepts, and have some fun with code.

## ✍️ What's This About?

- Solving **CodeWars katas** and similar coding exercises
- Practicing core C++ concepts and syntax
- Revising algorithms and problem-solving techniques
- Keeping my brain sharp with small, focused problems

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C++ (17/20)**
- Compiled and tested on **Linux** and **Windows**.


## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Algorithms & data structures
- Recursion, loops, logic puzzles
- STL (vectors, maps, sets, etc.)
- C++ best practices and clean code

## 🚧 Note

This is a personal space for growth and experimentation – some code may be messy or purely exploratory.  
If you're also learning, feel free to explore and maybe get inspired!
